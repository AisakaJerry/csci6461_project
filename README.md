> Author: Zeyuan Feng; Pranay Patodi; Zhen Wang (Sorted by last name)

## Part I Deliverable (See syllabus: (Part I – 5 points)

Your simulator, packaged as a JAR file.
Simple documentation describing how to use your simulator, what the console layout is and how to operate it.
Your team’s design notes
Source code – well documented.

You should be able to enter data into any of R0 – R3; enter data into memory via switches; enter the various Load and Store instructions instructions into memory; enter address into PC and press Single Step switch to execute the instruction at that address.

For this deliverable, when the IPL button is pushed the machine should pre load a program that shows that the machine works and stop at the beginning, ready for the user to hit run or single step.  This program will be short but show all addressing modes for the load and store instructions, allowing single step through. The program.  Memory contents at the address given in the MAR should be on the user console.  

## Part II Deliverables (See syllabus): (10 Points)

1. Cache Design and Implementation
2. Have all instructions working except Part IV 
3. Have your cache design at least coded out if not working

Demonstrate that individual instructions work. 
Your user interface, e.g., operator’s console should be used to test instructions, etc. Include source code for Program 1.
Your simulator, packaged as a JAR file, running program 1.
File containing program 1 as machine code.
Demonstration that Program 1 works.

Simple documentation describing how to use your simulator, what the console layout is and how to operate it.

Your team’s design notes
Source code – well documented.

## Part III Deliverables 15 points

Your simulator, packaged as a JAR file, running program 2
Load instructions from a file.
Simple documentation describing how to use your simulator, what the console layout is and how to operate it. Include source code for program 2.
File containing program 2 as machine code.
Your team’s design notes
Source code – well documented.
Demonstration that Program 2 works.

## Part IV Deliverable 20 points

Your simulator, packaged as a JAR file, running programs 1 and 2.
Updated documentation for your simulator. Include source code for programs 1, 2.
Files containing programs 1, 2 as machine code.
Additional design notes.
Source code – well documented.

If you choose IVa, you should write a simple program that demonstrates floating point add/subtract, vector add/subtract, and floating point conversion.
